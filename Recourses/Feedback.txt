I am not programmer but I think it is good job. But I have some idea, you can add more functions if window where has
big photo of Ala Too university. For example, information about student or his grades. By the way good project.
It is not limit.

The design is so simple that the user won’t find any difficulties while working on it. In order to run the project,
you must have installed Python and on your PC. This is a simple application system application for beginners.
Excellent work.

I’m impressed, it well deserves recognition. Given the nature of the assignment, that’s great. However, some of your
specific arguments need developed - the message that appears when you enter an incorrect password or name disappears
very quickly. You could make this message last longer. Overall, it’s clear that you put a lot of effort and time.

The project is good but useless. You could do the same only online inside the site. But for language learning you can.
Try to create something really necessary for the next time. I believe in you and hope that you get good grades
for this project

Honestly, I do not interest two programming. Therefore, I cannot say much About this program. But I noticed that this
program works properly, I entered invalid symbols and characters and the program continued working properly.
I Think it is a good indication of the program. Also, he wrote tutorial about his project, it means he did a good job.

I am one of those people who looked at your login program. Considering you're only one semester in your first year,
I think this is a good achievement for a beginner programmer. The program works like any ordinary one, without errors
and makes our life easier for us. Great job! The feedback should be provided on realistic grounds that keeps the window
open for improvement. Of course there is always somewhere to grow. I believe you can create a useful program.
I wish you good luck.

The mind of the person who created this program is clear and broad-minded, because at least the design is very
beautifully reflected, and at the same time the program works and the system is good. Kutman Eshenkulov Create other
programs and achieve great success in the future. The program you are currently preparing is even better! Now I hope
that you will achieve many more successes in your undergraduate.
